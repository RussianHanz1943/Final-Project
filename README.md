# Final-Project
Project for Computer Programming 1
This is the Resistor Color Code Converter that converts the user's input of different color combinations and converting them to their respective resistance values and information. Also, this code can convert the user's input of resistance and information and converting them to the matching color combination. This program features a login module, wherein you can login or signup before entering the program itself. Additionally, this contains a mini-program called "Circuit Builder" wherein you choose a power source of you choice then a load for the circuit. Then it displays the information about the status of the load based on your chosen power source.
